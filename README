Super Space Trader is going to be a port of Space Trader for the palm pilot from 2002. The point of this project is to teach myself test-driven development in Java and keep my fleeting Java and programming knowledge from completely fading away from memory, due to too much scripting in PHP and Python these past years. 

The main goal is to create an engine and an backend that will not be dependant on how the gui is implemented.

Wish me luck.
